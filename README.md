# IEEE-HW-SW-Comp
The 2024 IEEE Mobile Chapter Hardware-Software Design Challenge

We won first place for our design.  See the rules markdown document for what we had to do.

We also tried to implement it using PyGame and the serial library in python, so that an Android device was not needed; however, we never finished it, but the code is uploaded here anyways.
